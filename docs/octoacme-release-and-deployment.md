## Rollback & Incident Playbook

### When to Rollback
Initiate rollback immediately if:
- **Critical functionality is broken** for most users
- **Data corruption or loss** is occurring
- **Severe performance degradation** affecting user experience
- **Security vulnerability** introduced in new release
- **Cascade failure** impacting other systems

### Rollback Procedure
1. **Declare Incident**
   - Notify on-call and incident commander
   - Create incident channel (Slack, Teams)
   - Start incident log with timeline

2. **Execute Rollback**
   - Follow documented rollback procedure
   - Revert to last known-good release
   - Verify rollback successful
   - Run smoke tests to confirm stability
   - Monitor error rates and logs

3. **Verify Restoration**
   - Confirm critical flows working
   - Check user-reported issues resolved
   - Verify data consistency
   - Monitor for 30-60 minutes post-rollback

4. **Communicate**
   - Update stakeholders on rollback completion
   - Update status page (if customer-facing)
   - Brief support team on status
   - Document incident timeline

5. **Post-Rollback**
   - Triage root cause of failure
   - Create issues for fixes needed
   - Schedule blameless post-mortem
   - Update rollback procedure if improvements identified

### Incident Response Process

**If deployment fails or causes a critical issue**:

#### 1. Trigger Incident Response
- Notify on-call engineer immediately
- Create incident channel
- Assign incident commander
- Start documenting timeline

#### 2. Assess Severity
**SEV-1 (Critical)**:
- Complete outage or data loss
- Affects all or most users
- No workaround available
- Response time: Immediate

**SEV-2 (High)**:
- Major functionality impaired
- Affects many users
- Workaround may exist
- Response time: Within 1 hour

**SEV-3 (Medium)**:
- Minor functionality issue
- Affects some users
- Workaround available
- Response time: Within 4 hours

#### 3. Execute Response
- Decide: Fix forward or rollback?
- If rollback: Follow rollback procedure
- If fix forward: Implement hotfix with accelerated process
- Monitor impact continuously
- Keep stakeholders updated every 30-60 minutes

#### 4. Restore Service
- Verify fix/rollback successful
- Monitor for continued issues
- Communicate restoration to stakeholders
- Continue monitoring for 24-48 hours

#### 5. Post-Incident Activities
- Complete incident report
- Schedule blameless retrospective within 48 hours
- Create action items from learnings
- Update runbooks and procedures
- Share learnings with broader team

## Best Practices for Releases

### Planning Releases
- **Regular cadence**: Establish predictable release schedule
- **Release trains**: Use time-boxed releases for predictability
- **Feature flags**: Decouple deployment from feature activation
- **Small batches**: Smaller, more frequent releases reduce risk

### Communication
- **Advance notice**: Notify stakeholders at least 48 hours before release
- **Clear release notes**: Focus on user impact, not technical details
- **Support readiness**: Brief support team before release
- **Customer communication**: Plan communications for customer-facing changes

### Quality Gates
- Don't skip testing to meet a deadline
- Have clear go/no-go criteria
- Empower team to delay release if quality concerns exist
- Better to delay than to release broken software

### Continuous Improvement
- Review release process after each major release
- Track metrics: deployment frequency, lead time, failure rate, MTTR
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Document and share lessons learned

### Emergency Releases (Hotfixes)
- Follow abbreviated but not skipped process
- At minimum: code review, automated tests, staging deployment
- Communicate urgency and scope clearly
- Always schedule post-incident retrospective
- Document what enabled the issue to reach production
